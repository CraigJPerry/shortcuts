Keyboard Shortcuts
==================

I'm lazy. If there was an Olympic competition for laziness, i would
be summarily banned on suspicion of using performance enhancing drugs.
I *take^W*, have it on my todo list, to take pride in being the laziest
IT guy you ever met!

I learn the time saving keyboard shortcuts of most of my apps. To save
effort i use the open source Anki_ spaced repetition software to drum
them into my thick skull.

**It works**, for all apps, all the time and it takes zero effort.


How It Works
------------

All the decks of flash cards are in this repo, in plain text. The Anki_
app consumes the decks in the following format:

* 1 deck per application (= 1 file per application)
* 1 (tab separated) line per card
  * Field 1: Question
  * Field 2: Answer
  * Field 3: Category

Anki_ runs on Linux, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS or via their website.

Anki takes care of scheduling your study and mixing up cards from the
available decks. You should read up on the theory behind Anki_ since I
won't repeat the why's and how's of spaced repetition here; I'm too
lazy ;-)
